This repository contains the files, referred to in my pihole installation [manual](http://users.telenet.be/MySQLplaylist/pi-hole.pdf).

The googleads script is explained [here](http://users.telenet.be/MySQLplaylist/googleads.pdf).

Read [this](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/doh-dns-over-https-ip-block-list-s/30393) topic (pihole forum) for additional info on the DoH IP lists.

Some scripts may contain IP addresses, which need to be edited, to allow correct processing.
